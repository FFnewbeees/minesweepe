# Minesweeper Game 
### Built by Next.JS, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

## Requirements
1. The size of the board and number of mines should be configurable.
2. The game state should be persistent on the client so refreshing the page or navigating
away/back does not lose the current game. 
3. The player should also be able to start a new game if they havenâ€™t finished their current game.
4. The UI can have any styling you wish and does not
need to be a direct copy of the windows variant.

## Additional Features
The code should be written to the standard you are comfortable with for a production
environment for example documentation and testing.

## Notes
As you will run out of time, we suggest making sure to do a little bit of each part (code,
documentation and testing) rather than just focusing on getting a single part correct, and
attempt to write notes about what you would have done to complete the task if you had more
time.
